# Intro To Computer Science

- All assignments written in Python 2.7

- Honestly there wasn't much organization in this folder and really this directory here is more for just keeping these notes in case I ever need to look back for some reason
	- I do have one or two ideas for games hidden in here so that's really why I have this.
	- One game has a Hanzo-v-Genji flavor/story where you are running room to room trying to assasinate each other.

- Anyways I learned basic knowledge past the very little I taught myself in Highschool.
	- including functions, loops, input, error exceptions, libraries/modules, and introduction to object orientation.
	- Of course I learned more; to see those, check the assignment directories for a more in-depth list.

- Grade: A-
