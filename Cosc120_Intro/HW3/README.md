Score: 18/20

The prompt is in this directory and titled prompt3.pdf 

Quick Summary of what question set entailed

- Reading input and testing if it's a palindrome
- error checking
- simulating probability of drawing a card from a deck
- testing Goldbach's conjecture from any inputted integer from 2 to 100
- Using bisection-method to tell how quickly on object hits the floor with variables

- The game
	- In the directory you see one titled "Errored Final." This was the game I made for the class
	- It says Errored Final because first of all the final was able to be any project we wanted and I wanted to improve on the game I made for this assignment.
	- The game worked (and the final did too, check the Final directory) but I didn't back up the game for this assignment when making the Final
	- But then after turning in the final, I tried to keep working on it then broke it and stored it here for myself.
		- meant to work on it again but haven't gotten to it, but I do want to bring the idea to reality (and make it even better)
