## Professor Notes

PointST: nearest() and range() both OK. KdTreeST: nearest() and range() both OK. Nice job on those. Analysis: You stated some results (number of operations per second), but you did not provide the raw data on which those were based. You included modified versions of the visualizer code that you used for timing purposes, but when I run "java BruteNearestNeighborVisualizer testing/input10K.txt". for example, the output is a bunch of repeated lines containing just the number "3484". I'm not sure what that means.
