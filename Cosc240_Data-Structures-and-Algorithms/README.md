# Data Structures and Algorithms

- All assignments written in Java

- Course focused on learning of the use of algorithms to implement Data Structures efficiently
	- Then hpw to use these Data Structures in to carry out algorithms
- Calculation of complexity
- Inheritence

- Examples of these, and more specific explanations, found in assignment directories
	
- Grade: TBA


- NOTE: descriptions to each assignment will come in next commit
